Here, I noticed one fact that if a language X has more speaker than another language Y, and still chef is not learning the language X, then he would not learn Y as well. So I sorted the list of frequencies of language speakers to descending order. I have defined a function series_sum to account for the rate of translator. I iterated over a loop stating that out of the two conditions: either fixed cost(C) now +  + translator cost from next index or translator cost from current index, whichever be smaller, add that to total cost. Translator cost refers to the natural number series summation: k(k+1)/2, where k is the summation of frequencies from current index frequency till the last index, this is done as there is no mathematical difference between spending on translator for two different languages or for two people from the same language.
